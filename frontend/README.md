# ScoringNidra - The High-Performance Open-Source Sleep EEG Visualization, Annotation & Scoring Software

Welcome to **ScoringNidra**, a high-performance, cross-platform desktop application designed to assist researchers and clinicians in sleep EEG visualization, event annotation, and sleep stage scoring.

Rebuilt from the ground up using **Flutter** for a lightweight, fluid UI, and **Rust** for native-speed signal processing, **ScoringNidra** is a modernized, standalone recreation of the Python-based [ScoringHero](https://github.com/SvennoNito/ScoringHero) repository. It operates without any complex Python or MATLAB runtime setup, bringing near-instant response times to massive sleep EEG files.

## About

**ScoringNidra** is designed to overcome the performance lag and dependency hurdles of traditional sleep scoring applications. By combining the reactive rendering of Flutter with the computational muscle of Rust (via background Isolates and FFI), the application effortlessly handles full-night EEG recordings, real-time filtering, dynamic Welch periodograms, and Morlet wavelet decompositions.

## 📥 Download Pre-built Releases

No installation of Python, MATLAB, or other runtime dependencies is required. Standing alone as pre-compiled binaries, you can download the latest builds directly:

*   **macOS (Universal ZIP)**: [Download for macOS](https://github.com/arunsasidharan84/ScoringNidra/releases/download/latest/ScoringNidra-macos.zip)
*   **Windows (x64 Installer EXE)**: [Download for Windows](https://github.com/arunsasidharan84/ScoringNidra/releases/download/latest/ScoringNidra-Installer.exe)

*(These links always point to the latest pre-built releases compiled automatically via GitHub Actions).*

### For Mac Users
Because the application is signed ad-hoc, you must clear the macOS Gatekeeper quarantine flag after downloading and extracting it:
1.  Open **Terminal** and navigate to your extracted folder.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```sh
    xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ScoringNidra.app
    ```
3.  Right-click `ScoringNidra.app` and choose **Open**.

## ⚡ Speed & Architectural Enhancements

ScoringNidra overcomes the main performance bottlenecks of standard Python-based visualization tools:

1.  **Hybrid Flutter + Rust FFI Pipeline**: Heavy mathematical operations (zero-phase Chebyshev/Butterworth filters, Welch periodograms, Morlet wavelets) are written in Rust, leveraging SIMD compiler optimizations and multi-threaded processing via `rayon`.
2.  **Isolate-Based Background Worker**: Computations run off the main thread in background Dart **Isolates**, leaving the main interface to render at a locked 60+ FPS.
3.  **Zero-Copy Memory Access**: Transfers between Dart and Rust utilize direct pointers and `.asTypedList` buffer access to avoid slow copy loops.
    *   *Benchmarks*: Night-wide spectrogram updates complete in just **19 ms**, and wavelet time-frequency updates finish in **113 ms**.
4.  **No Dependency Hell**: Runs without setting up a Python virtual environment or virtual dependencies. Executables are entirely self-contained.

## Features

### Multi-Channel EEG Signal Display
*   View multiple EEG channels simultaneously with configurable vertical spacing.
*   Adjust per-channel amplitude scaling and vertical offsets.
*   Predefined, high-contrast channel colors (Black, Blue, Green, Magenta, Orange, Cyan).
*   Add amplitude reference lines and 1-second grid overlays.
*   **Stack channels** on a shared baseline for direct overlay comparison.
*   **Robust z-standardization** (median/IQR normalization) for cross-channel comparison.
*   Configurable time axis units: Seconds, Minutes, or Hours.

### Sleep Stage Scoring
*   Score epochs (default 30s) as **Wake** (`W`), **N1** (`1`), **N2** (`2`), **N3** (`3`), **REM** (`R`), or **Inconclusive** (`I`).
*   Clear a score using the `Delete` key.
*   **Confidence Flagging**: Press `Q` (or the "Toggle uncertain" toolbar button) to flag an epoch as uncertain. Flagged epochs are visually marked on the hypnogram step timeline for later review and saved with low-confidence metadata.
*   Automatic save prompts on close if epochs remain unscored.

### Compare Scoring
*   Import a second scoring file (**Compare → Import scoring for comparison**) to evaluate against the current scoring.
*   **Disagreement Bands**: Epochs with conflicting scores are highlighted directly in the hypnogram timeline with a transparent red background band and a red bottom edge indicator. The disagreement bands are drawn in the background, ensuring that the step chart lines remain clearly visible.
*   **Premium Scoring Report Card**: Displays Cohen's Kappa score ($\kappa$) with strength labels, a dynamically color-shaded Confusion Matrix (green for agreement, red for disagreement, opacity scaled based on counts), and per-stage Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), and F1-Scores.

### Event Annotation
*   **13 event types**: Artefact (`A`) + 12 fully customizable event markers (`F1`–`F12`).
*   Draw event regions directly on the signal using click-and-drag selection boxes.
*   Real-time display of event duration (seconds) and amplitude while drawing.
*   Double-click on an existing event to remove it.
*   **Erase events in selection**: Draw selection boxes and press `Backspace` to delete all events inside the drawn region.
*   Events are rendered dynamically on both the signal view and the hypnogram timeline.
